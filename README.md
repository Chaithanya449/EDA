# EDA
Performed EDA on cardiotocography dataset .Understood data distribution and produced stunnig visualizations using matplot and seaborn.The primary goal of this Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was to explore and understand patterns in the Cardiotocography dataset, which records fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine contraction (UC) measurements. These indicators are crucial for monitoring fetal well-being during pregnancy. By analyzing this dataset, the objective was to gain meaningful insights that could support early detection of abnormal fetal conditions and potentially assist healthcare professionals in decision-making.
